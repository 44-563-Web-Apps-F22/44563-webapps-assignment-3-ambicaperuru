            <p><b>Perseus the panther</b> is the mascot of State University of New York at Purchase</p>
        <h2>Perseus the Panther</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The campus made suggestions back in 2007 and it came down to Picasso, Pride and Perseus and Perseus won out.</li>
            <li>What do you do to get pumped before a game? "We high-five the Paw!" </li>
            <li>In January 2007, the campus gave me my name, Perseus, honoring the Greek mythology figure of the same name. </li>
            <li>His coat looks shiner and bluer, and to celebrate the new beach body, the popular mascot is sporting some new threads â€“ an orange and blue jersey with his name and the No. 1!</li>
